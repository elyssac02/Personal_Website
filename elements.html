							<p>For my Geovisualization class at the Center for Geospatial Analytics at NCSU, I developed a Web GIS dashboard in order to visualize future
								vulnerability to flooding. The dasboard shows multiple different maps and plots of simulations and spatial analysis that were derived using
								the Future Urban and Regional Environment Simulation (FUTURES) and Height Above the Nearst Drainage (HAND) methodology of 4 HUC10 watersheds
								near Wilmington, NC:
							</p>

							<p>
								1) Map: Inundation simulations for September 13th, 2018 - September 17th, 2018, representing 1 day prior to and 4 days following the landfall of Hurricane
								Florence
							</p>
							<p>
								2) Map: FUTURES urbanization simulations for the years 2025, 2030, 2035, and 2038
							</p>
							<p>
								3) Map: Change in urban vulerability to flooding between 2025 to 2038
							</p>
							<p>
								4) Plot: km^2 of inundated developed land during each day of Hurricane Florence, visualized for each year of the FUTURES simulation
							</p>
							<p>
								5) Plot: km^2 of inundated developed land during each year of the FUTURES simulation, visulized for different ranges of inundation levels
							</p>
							<p>
								6) Plot: km^2 of projected developed land in the study area
							</p>

							<p>
								For the Hurricane Florence inundation simulations, I used the National Water Model (NWM) integrated HAND
								methodology. The NWM simulates observed and forecast streamflows (m^3/sec) for each stream reach in the National Hydrography Dataset in CONUS.
								It simulates the water cycle and the effects of extreme variability in precipitation and produces hourly outputs. I obtained analysis and assimilation
								product data for 12pm for each day between September 13 and  September 17, 2018, so inundation analyses represent inundation on 12pm of that day.
								Hurricane Florence made landfall at 7:15 a.m. on Friday, September 14. HAND normalizes digital elevtion models according to distributed vertical
								distances relative to the drainage channels (i.e., the "height" is 0 m if located in a river) and is used to simulate inundation based on a stage
								height. Linear regressions are developed for each rating curve (discharge - stage height relations) for each stream reach and are used to convert
								the NWM discharges to stage heights. Next, inundation is simulated along each stream segment based on the stage height, contributing area, and HAND,
								with separate simulations for each day of Florence.
							</p>

							<p> For the FUTURES urbanization simulations, I simulated locations of development for the years 2025, 2030, 2035, and 2038. The FUTURES devlepment
								 	simulations were coupled with the HAND inundation simulations in order to spatially analyze urban flood vulnerability. In the map, one can
									select different years of the FUTURES simulation to visualize and spatially overlay the Hurricane Florence inundation maps to see which developed
									lands would be affected for that year. Changing the FUTURES simulation year from say 2025 - 2038 would show that the amount of developed lands
									affected by flooding increases with increasing development in certain areas. Basically, the map shows how increases in development that are likely
									to occur in the future will be affected by a Hurricane Florence flooding scenario. The plots show more specific inundation details, in numbers of km^2 of
									developed lands, for each year of the FUTURES simulation, as well as for different inundation levels (low, medium, and high). The change in urban
									vulnerability to flooding map shows the change in the total m of inundation experienced throughout Hurricane Florence (each day summed) for developed locations
									between 2025 and 2038, pinpointing future potential highly vulnerable urban areas. This signifies the purpose of this research and the dashboard: how
									can we develop urban management plans with the goal to minimize flood risk? Future work will simulate FUTURES under various urban planning scenarios
									(sprawl, infill, preventing development in the floodplain) and evaluate how flood risk changes based on the urban management scenario. Future flooding
									scenarios will also be developed in order to understand flood risk under future hydrologic conditions/climate change. The current data displayed on
									the dashboard is prototype data until more concrete/refined methods are developed to create new maps/plots.
